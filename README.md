In this project I am exploring whether or not countries with a higher percentage of forest coverage fare better during certain natural disasters, specifically floods, droughts and extreme temperatures. Data used in this project will be pulled from Gapminder.org, from their forestry datasets and disaster datasets under their environment
category. I have also pulled a dataset on total population so that comparison between affected can be drawn on per/capita in each country.

Questions to answer:
1. Do countries with a higher percentage of forest coverage have a lower number of affected from floods, droughts and extreme temperatures?
2. Which natural disaster type affects the most countries on a per/capita basis in countries with the lowest percentage of forest coverage?
3. Over time, do countries where forest coverage increases have decreaseing number of those affected by disasters?

This repository is a collection of submitted project material.
